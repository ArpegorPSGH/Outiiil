# Product Context: Outiiil

## Why this project exists
The Outiiil project exists to enhance the gameplay experience of Fourmizzz players by providing tools and information that are not readily available in the base game.

## Problems it solves
Outiiil addresses the lack of certain tools and the decentralization of information in Fourmizzz, which makes daily management and long-term strategy difficult for players, especially within an alliance. Tasks such as tracking activities, sharing key information, or optimizing actions (hunting, flooding) can be repetitive or require manual calculations.

## How it should work
Outiiil injects itself into the pages of the Fourmizzz game to:
1.  **Centralize Information:** Display a quick overview of current layings, constructions, research, and troop movements in a dedicated box.
2.  **Provide Contextual Tools:** Add buttons, calculators, and visual aids on specific pages (Army, Resources, Forum, Profiles, etc.) to simplify common actions. This includes enhancing the command table on the Commerce page with additional information like the command creation date, and adding supplementary columns on the Alliance members page. Access to these features is conditional on the user having a dedicated topic in the configured Alliance Members forum section.
3.  **Facilitate Alliance Communication:** Enable coordinated actions via the internal forum (e.g., SDC management, sharing statistics via the "Recensement" function).

## User experience goals
- **Seamless Integration:** The extension should integrate visually and functionally with the game without being intrusive.
- **Time Saving:** Automate or simplify repetitive tasks.
- **Decision Support:** Provide calculated or aggregated information to aid strategy.
- **Reliability:** The information displayed and actions performed must be accurate and correspond to the actual state of the game.
